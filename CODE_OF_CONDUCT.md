# Code of Conduct

In this porject, I will host the script, and will follow best practices to create supporting documents guiding our team.

Our community is dedicated to providing a positive and respectful experience for everyone. We expect all members to uphold the following values:

- Respect the boundaries and feelings of others
- Treat others with kindness and consideration
- Do not engage in harassment or discrimination of any kind

If you witness or experience a violation of these values, please report it to the appropriate authorities 
or contact the [Yidi](mailto:Yidi@startup.com).
